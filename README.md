# Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`

# Notes

- If this were a real application, I would prefer to use something like [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io) to handle the searching. However, for a technical assignment, I believe it's better not to rely on a library to do all the work for me ðŸ˜›
- That being said, it would be cool to implement stuff like fuzzy search with more time. Anyways, I'm quite satisfied with the current state.
